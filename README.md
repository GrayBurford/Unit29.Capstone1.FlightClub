### Description: 
The Flight Club initiative was started shortly after my years working as an int'l travel manager. 
The 3 pillars that make Flight Club work:
1. Every major airline has a free and easy-to-use rewards program.
2. Most major credit cards accumulate points for the card holder based on purchases on that card that can be transferred to a dozen or more airline programs.
3. It's now more common, easy, and available than ever in history to fly.
